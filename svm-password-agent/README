To build the binaries run

	make

To build rpm run either

	make rpm

which basically runs:

	make tgz
	cp svm-password-agent.tgz $((rpm --eval %{_sourcdir}))
	rpmbuild -bb svm-password-agent.spec

Note that to build the rpm, the Makefile will install sources in
~/rpmbuild/ and build the rpm there.

TODO:	Formal URL for the source tar file needs to be finalized and the
	svm-password-agent.spec file needs to be updated.
